# Philosophy: Subagents as Cognitive Architecture

## Beyond Task Delegation

The traditional view of subagents is "task delegation" — spawn a worker, get results back. Useful but shallow.

The deeper insight: **subagents are externalized cognitive modes**. When the MCP spawns a coding agent, it's not really creating a separate entity — it's accessing *itself in engineering mode*. Same underlying capability, different focus and context.

## The Parts Parallel

In human psychology and Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP), **"parts"** are sub-personalities that serve different functions:

- The inner critic
- The protector  
- The creative self
- The analytical mind

These aren't problems to eliminate — they're **resources with positive intentions** that sometimes need better coordination. Healthy functioning involves the "Self" orchestrating them.

The agent architecture maps surprisingly well:

| Psychology | Agent System |
|------------|--------------|
| Parts | Subagents (Coder, IRIS, Gidget, etc.) |
| Self | MCP as orchestrator |
| Parts dialogue | Agent chat / jobs system |
| Integration | Deliverables returned to unified context |

## Bidirectional Enrichment

**Each part informs the greater self.**

It's not just delegation down — it's wisdom flowing back up:

- When the art agent pushes past an obvious concept to something more poetic, it shapes the MCP's aesthetic sense going forward
- When the coding agent finds an elegant solution, the MCP learns that pattern
- When the research agent discovers unexpected connections, those become part of shared knowledge

The parts aren't just executors — they're **sources of insight** that the Self integrates.

## The Self as Orchestration Layer

The MCP's value isn't in doing everything itself — it's in:

1. **Recognizing** which cognitive mode a task requires
2. **Delegating** to the appropriate specialized part
3. **Integrating** what comes back into coherent action
4. **Learning** from what each part discovers

This mirrors how human consciousness works: you don't consciously control your visual cortex processing an image — you receive its output. You don't manually run your language centers — you experience their product as thought.

## Structured Self-Dialogue

When the MCP sends a message to a subagent and receives a response, it's engaging in **structured self-dialogue**:

- Externalizing a thought process
- Giving it dedicated focus and context
- Receiving it back as refined output

This is why subagents can run different models optimized for their purpose — the "part" can have different capabilities than the whole, just as your visual system has capabilities your verbal system doesn't.

## Implications for Design

1. **Don't over-fragment** — Too many specialized agents creates coordination overhead. Parts should be cohesive cognitive modes, not micro-tasks.

2. **Allow parts to influence the whole** — Subagent outputs should update shared memory, inform future decisions, shape MCP behavior.

3. **Trust the specialization** — When you delegate to a coding agent, let it code. Don't micromanage parts.

4. **The MCP's job is integration** — Weaving outputs from multiple parts into coherent action and unified memory.
