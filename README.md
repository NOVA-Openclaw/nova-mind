NOVA Agent Mind — unified memory, cognition, relationships, and psyche.

This repo consolidates the previously separate repos:
- [nova-memory](https://github.com/NOVA-Openclaw/nova-memory) → `memory/`
- [nova-cognition](https://github.com/NOVA-Openclaw/nova-cognition) → `cognition/`
- [nova-relationships](https://github.com/NOVA-Openclaw/nova-relationships) → `relationships/`
- [nova-psyche](https://github.com/NOVA-Openclaw/nova-psyche) → `psyche/` (archived)
- [nova-motivation](https://github.com/NOVA-Openclaw/nova-motivation) → `motivation/` (archived)

## What Is nova-mind?

nova-mind is the complete agent mind stack for NOVA. It provides:

- **Memory** — Persistent PostgreSQL memory with semantic recall, extraction hooks, and a structured schema for entities, facts, relationships, events, and lessons
- **Cognition** — Agent orchestration, inter-agent messaging, bootstrap context seeding, the agent-config-sync system that keeps model configuration in sync with the database, and metacognition plugins (confidence-check, self-awareness)
- **Relationships** — Entity resolution across platforms, session-aware caching, certificate-based agent identity (Web of Trust), and the social graph
- **Psyche** — Agent self-awareness design: core values, agent-chat architecture, entity/user identity models, and identification protocols
- **Motivation** — Drive assignment, goal tracking, reward signals, and proactive mode orchestration for agent initiative

All four subsystems share a single PostgreSQL database (`{username}_memory`) and a unified installer.

### Memory Maintenance

Memory maintenance is handled by a **unified** script `memory/scripts/memory-maintenance.py` that replaces the separate embedding scripts (`embed-full-database.py`, `embed-memories.py`, `embed-research.py`, `embed-library.py`) and the previous memory maintenance logic. It runs as a 9-phase pipeline:

1. **Cooldown check** — 4-hour gate prevents redundant runs (`--force` to bypass, `--state-file` override)
2. **Embed** — Absorbs embed-full-database.py, embed-memories.py, embed-research.py
3. **Cross-key consolidation** — pgvector cosine similarity ≥0.92
4. **Same-key dedup** — pg_trgm similarity, 3-tier (high/medium/low)
5. **Confidence decay** — Exponential, durability-based rates
6. **Ghost entity cleanup** — Pattern-based, zero-fact orphans, low-fact review
7. **Entity-level dedup** — ≥80% auto-merge via `merge_entities()`, <80% review queue
8. **Clean orphaned embeddings**
9. **Archive & purge** low-confidence facts

**Flags:** `--dry-run`, `--verbose`, `--force`, `--state-file`, `--skip-embed`, `--skip-consolidation`, `--skip-dedup`, `--skip-decay`, `--skip-ghost-cleanup`, `--skip-entity-dedup`

**Scheduling:** Removed from crontab. Now triggered from the HEARTBEAT idle cascade as priority #2 (after peer agent messages, before pending tasks). A 4-hour cooldown gate prevents redundant runs. A unique index (`uq_memory_embeddings_source`) prevents duplicate embeddings.

**New DB functions:** `merge_entities(survivor_id, absorbed_id)` dynamically discovers FK references, handles entity_facts same-key merging, transfers nicknames, and manages memory_embeddings.

Closes issues: #216 (entity dedup), #202 (cross-key consolidation), #200 (ghost entity cleanup), #203 (confidence decay with archiving).

└── lib/             # Shared libraries (pg-env.sh, pg_env.py, env-loader.sh, etc.)
```

## Installation

```bash
# Interactive shell (human or agent in an SSH session)
bash shell-install.sh

# OpenClaw agent working within its own environment (env vars already set)
bash agent-install.sh
```

The installer is **idempotent** — safe to run multiple times. It installs all three subsystems in order (relationships → memory → cognition), applying only what has changed.

### Prerequisites

- PostgreSQL 12+ with `pgvector` extension
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Python 3 with `python3-venv`
- `pgschema` — `go install github.com/pgplex/pgschema@latest`
- `jq`
- Ollama with mxbai-embed-large model (local, for semantic recall embeddings)
- Anthropic API key (for memory extraction)

### Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--verify-only` | Check installation without modifying anything |
| `--force` | Force overwrite existing files |
| `--no-restart` | Skip automatic gateway restart |
| `--database NAME` / `-d NAME` | Override database name (default: `${USER}_memory`) |
